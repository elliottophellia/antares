<h1 align="center">Antares</h1>

<p align="center">A self-hosted AI agent. Go backend, React dashboard, one binary.</p>

Antares reads and writes files, runs shell commands, drives a real browser,
searches the web, remembers what matters across sessions, retrieves from a
semantic index, schedules its own work, keeps working towards a goal across
turns, and answers from Telegram and Discord — all from a single process you run
on your own machine.

```
antares            # terminal UI
antares serve      # API + dashboard on :8787
antares setup      # configure it, in the browser or the terminal
```

## Why it is built this way

| Decision | Reason |
|---|---|
| Go backend, no framework | One static binary, no runtime to install, low idle memory. |
| `net/http` routing | Go 1.22 method+pattern routing covers every route here. |
| Pluggable storage | SQLite for a single node, Postgres when you outgrow it — same code. |
| Dashboard embedded in the binary | `make build` produces one file to copy anywhere. |
| Hand-rolled WebSocket client | The Discord gateway is the only consumer; a small `internal/wsutil` beats a dependency. |

Dependencies are deliberately few: a YAML parser, two database drivers. Everything
else is the standard library.

---

## Quick start

```bash
make install          # Go modules, Air, frontend packages
make build            # single binary with the dashboard embedded
./bin/antares         # first run drops straight into setup
```

Setup asks how you want to configure it:

```
    1  Browser   — a guided page in the dashboard
    2  Terminal  — a few questions right here
```

Both write the same `~/.antares/config.yaml`, so pick whichever is in front of
you. On a headless box the browser option prints every address the setup page is
reachable on, so you can finish from a laptop on the same network.

For development, run both servers with hot reload:

```bash
make dev              # backend (Air) + frontend (Vite)
```

- Dashboard: http://localhost:5173
- API: http://localhost:8787

Production build:

```bash
make build            # → bin/antares, dashboard embedded
./bin/antares serve
```

### Accessing it from another machine

Both dev servers bind `0.0.0.0`, so a private-network address works directly:

```
http://<tailscale-ip>:5173     # dev
http://<tailscale-ip>:8787     # production binary
```

Antares leaves the dashboard open when `server.auth_token` is empty, which is the
right default behind a private network. Set the token to require a bearer token.

---

## Configuration

Everything lives in `~/.antares/config.yaml`, editable from the dashboard, the
CLI, or the file itself. Environment variables override the file; `~/.antares/.env`
is loaded automatically.

```bash
antares config get model.default
antares config set model.default anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5
antares config path
```

| Key | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `model.default` / `model.provider` | Which model answers |
| `providers.*` | Endpoints and API keys |
| `database.driver` | `sqlite`, `postgres`, or `memory` |
| `tools.toolset` | Which tools the model gets: `minimal`, `coding`, `research`, `default`, `all` |
| `rag.provider` | `builtin` (internal vector store) or `enowx` (enowx-rag daemon) |
| `gateway.telegram` / `gateway.discord` | Messaging bots |
| `tools.browser` | The real-browser tool: executable, viewport, headed mode |
| `agent.verify_replies` | Check a finished answer against the request before showing it |

### Providers

Any OpenAI-compatible endpoint works out of the box; Anthropic and Gemini have
native adapters so reasoning, prompt caching, and vision behave correctly.

| Provider | Kind | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| OpenRouter | `openai-compatible` | Default. Model ids stay slash-qualified. |
| OpenAI | `openai` | |
| Anthropic | `anthropic` | Extended thinking, prompt caching |
| Google Gemini | `gemini` | Thinking budgets |
| Ollama / LM Studio / vLLM | `openai-compatible` | Point `base_url` at the local server |
| Anything else | `custom` | Set `base_url` and `api_key` |

### Storage

```yaml
database:
  driver: sqlite
  dsn: ~/.antares/antares.db
```

```yaml
database:
  driver: postgres
  dsn: postgres://user:pass@localhost:5432/antares?sslmode=disable
```

SQLite uses FTS5 for conversation search; Postgres uses `tsvector`. Both are
created automatically on first run.

## What it can do

**Tools.** File read/write/edit, directory listing, glob, regex search, a
persistent shell (working directory and environment survive between calls), a
real browser, web search and fetch, long-term memory, cross-session search,
semantic retrieval, task lists, skill authoring, and sub-agent delegation.

**A real browser.** Antares drives an actual Chromium over the DevTools
protocol — no driver binary and no Node. Pages are described rather than
screenshotted: a snapshot lists what a person could act on, each with a
reference the model names to click or type into. The page persists between
tool calls, so a login holds while the agent keeps working. See
[docs/browser.md](docs/browser.md).

**Specialist roles.** The agent is a team of specialists, not one generalist —
a reviewer that only reads, a researcher that only browses, a report writer that
only writes. `/role` runs a conversation as one; the agent delegates a piece of
work to the specialist suited to it. Thirteen ship, including a security set for
authorized penetration testing, gated on a scope you control. See
[docs/roles.md](docs/roles.md).

**Slash commands.** `/status`, `/model`, `/skills`, `/goal`, and two dozen more
work identically in the terminal, in the web chat, and in a Telegram or Discord
thread, because all three dispatch through one definition. The web composer
completes them as you type. See [docs/commands.md](docs/commands.md).

**A hub.** Skills and MCP servers have a browsable catalogue with one-click
install. Eight skills ship inside the binary; beyond those, a skill can come
from any public GitHub repository or any URL serving a `SKILL.md`. Installed
skills are scanned first — a skill is prompt text the model follows, so one that
pipes a download into a shell is refused rather than quietly obeyed. See
[docs/hub.md](docs/hub.md).

**A harness that survives long work.** A repetition guard catches a model
calling the same thing with the same arguments and tells it to change approach.
Steering delivers an instruction typed while a run is already going. Optional
verification runs a second model over a finished answer to catch work that was
described but not done. Standing goals outlive a turn: a judge decides whether
the goal is really met and, if not, names the next step. See
[docs/harness.md](docs/harness.md).

**Memory.** The agent decides what is worth keeping and writes it to durable
storage. Memories are injected into the system prompt on every turn, bounded by
`memory.memory_char_limit`.

**RAG.** Two interchangeable backends:

- `builtin` — embeds with your configured model, stores vectors in the Antares
  database, optional hybrid dense + lexical fusion.
- `enowx` — delegates to an [enowx-rag](https://github.com/enowdev/enowx-rag)
  daemon, which brings reranking and near-duplicate compression.

**Skills.** Markdown files with YAML front matter in `~/.antares/skills`. The
agent writes its own after solving something non-obvious; the catalogue (names
and descriptions only) goes in the prompt, and full bodies are fetched on demand
so the context stays small.

**Scheduling.** A five-field cron parser plus `@daily`/`@every 90m` shorthands.
Jobs are natural-language prompts that run unattended and can deliver their
output to a messaging channel.

**Messaging.** Telegram (long polling, no public domain needed) and Discord
(websocket gateway). Both share the same sessions, memory, and tools, and both
gate access behind an allow list or a pairing approval flow.

**MCP.** External Model Context Protocol servers over stdio or streamable HTTP.
Their tools are namespaced `mcp__<server>__<tool>` and made available to the
model automatically; a server that fails to start is reported, never fatal.

**Two interfaces.** A full-screen terminal UI (`antares`) and a web dashboard
(`antares serve`) over the same agent, sessions, and memory. The TUI has a
multiline composer, slash-command completion, live tool output, history recall,
scrollback, and Ctrl+C interrupt. Run `/help` inside it for the full list.

**Context compaction.** As a conversation approaches the model's context window,
older turns are summarised while recent ones stay verbatim — and tool-call turns
are never split from their results.

web/                  React dashboard (Vite, Tailwind, shadcn-style, Phosphor)
```

The dashboard owns its layout centrally: `web/src/lib/routes.ts` declares every
page, and `AppShell` renders the container and header, so pages contain content
only. The interface ships in English, Indonesian, Japanese, Chinese, and Russian.

## Development

```bash
make dev         # backend (Air) + frontend (Vite), both hot-reloading
make dev-api     # backend only
make dev-web     # frontend only
make check       # go vet + go test + tsc
make smoke       # load every dashboard route in a real browser
make build       # single binary with the dashboard embedded
make doctor      # diagnose configuration and connectivity
```

`make smoke` exists because two of the worst bugs so far passed every type
check: a hook called from inside an effect, and the server bouncing SPA routes
to `./`. Both blanked the entire dashboard. Loading each route in a real browser
catches that class of failure; nothing static does.

`antares doctor` checks the config file, workspace, database, provider
credentials, and RAG backend in one pass.
